DirectX image overlay (via Direct3D surface)
=========================================================================
Camera_Net can use Direct3D image overlay.
It will allow you to use overlay with 8-bit alpha-channel, 
not 1-bit as in GDI colorkey mode.

NOTE 1: I don't really know why you should use Direct3D.
Probably it only makes sense if you're already using Direct3D in your application.

NOTE 2: Direct3D is dumb and this feature is deprecated for a long time.
The last Direct SDK that still has the managed wrappers is February 2010.

=========================================================================
Anyway, if you want to use DirectX bitmap overlay 
with Direct3D surfaces you should do several steps:

1) Download and install DirectX SDK 
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=10084
It'll make Microsoft.DirectX.Direct3D namespace available.
NOTE: Installation of DirectX SDK will require loathsome Microsoft validation.

2) Build Camera_Net library with additional definition: USE_D3D
It'll will #define "USE_D3D" for all files in library. 
Magic conditional macros will do all the rest tricks.

3) After rebuild Camera and CameraControl classes will have UseGDI property.
Set UseGDI to false after initializing camera (e.g. after CameraControl.SetCamera() call).

NOTE: There can be some build problems, I haven't used it for a long time 
and I think Direct3D is almost useless in this project.
